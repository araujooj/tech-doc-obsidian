React Query DevTools is a powerful tool that provides visibility into the state of your React Query cache. It helps you understand what queries are currently active, what their status is, when they were last updated, and what data they contain.

The React Query DevTools show you a list of all the queries in your application, organized by query key. Each query is displayed with its status (e.g., "loading", "error", "success"), and its last updated timestamp. This gives you a clear understanding of which queries are currently running, which have completed successfully, and which have encountered an error.

# Data Explorer

In addition to the query list, the React Query DevTools also include a data explorer. This allows you to explore the data in your React Query cache, see what data is stored for each query, and even modify the data if you need to. This is especially useful for debugging and testing purposes.

# Query Explorer

The query explorer is another powerful feature of the React Query DevTools. It allows you to see the query configuration for each query, including its key, its endpoint, and any options or parameters that were passed to the `useQuery` hook. This can help you understand how your queries are configured, and what data they are retrieving from the server.

In conclusion, the React Query DevTools are an essential tool for anyone working with React Query. They provide invaluable visibility into the state of your queries and cache, and help you understand how your application is managing its data. Whether you're developing a new application or troubleshooting an existing one, the React Query DevTools are an indispensable tool for building better, faster, and more reliable applications.
