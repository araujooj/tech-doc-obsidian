# Client State vs Server State

Client state and server state are two different categories of data in a web application, with different properties and use cases. Understanding the difference between these two types of state is important for effectively managing data in a web application.

## Client State

Client state refers to data that is relevant to a single browser session. It is stored in the client's browser and is accessible to the client-side code. This type of data is typically used to store information that is specific to the current user, such as their preferences or the state of the application.

Examples of client state include:

-   User's chosen language or theme
-   Shopping cart items
-   Current page or scroll position
-   Form input values

Client state is often stored in the browser's local storage, session storage, or in the React state. Because it is stored locally,  client state can be quickly accessed without having to make a round trip to the server. This can lead to a faster, more responsive user experience.

## Server State

Server state, on the other hand, refers to data that is stored on the server and is accessible to both client-side and server-side code. This type of data is typically used to store information that needs to persist across multiple browser sessions, such as user account information or application data.

Examples of server state include:

-   User account information (e.g. username, email, password)
-   Blog post data from the database
-   Product information for an e-commerce website
-   Analytics data

Because server state is stored on the server, it is less prone to data loss or tampering than client state. However, accessing server state requires a round trip to the server, which can lead to slower performance and increased network overhead.

In summary, both client state and server state have their own advantages and disadvantages, and understanding the differences between them is important for effectively managing data in a web application.

# What problem does React Query solve?

React Query is a state management library that solves problems related to data fetching, caching, and updates in React applications. It provides a unified API for performing data operations and helps to manage the complexity of making asynchronous requests, handling errors, and updating the UI.

React Query helps to simplify data management in React by:

1.  Automatically caching and deduplicating requests to reduce network overhead.
2.  Handling network errors and retries for you.
3.  Providing an API for manual cache updates and invalidations.
4.  Allowing for easy handling of optimistic updates and offline data changes.

In summary, React Query helps to streamline and simplify the process of fetching and managing data in React, allowing you to focus on building great user experiences.

# React Query Manages Data

React Query is a state management library for React that makes it easier to manage data in your applications. One of the key features of React Query is its ability to cache data, which can improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of network overhead.

React Query provides two ways to manage data: imperatively and declaratively.

## Imperative Cache Management

With imperative cache management, you can manually control the cache by invalidating data as needed. This allows you to fine-tune the cache to meet your specific needs.

For example, if you make a request for data from a server and the server returns an error, you can manually invalidate the cache to force a refetch of the data the next time it is requested. This can be useful for handling errors or for updating the cache with new data from the server.

To invalidate the cache imperatively, you can use the `invalidate` method provided by React Query. For example:

```js 
const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(['posts', id], () => fetch(`/api/posts/${id}`));

if (error) {
  // Invalidate the cache if there was an error
  data.invalidate();
}
```

## Declarative Cache Management

With declarative cache management, you can configure when and how data is fetched and updated in the cache.

For example, you can specify that data should only be refetched when the user has focus on the window, or when a specific interval has elapsed. This allows you to control the cache based on the user's experience and reduces the amount of unnecessary network overhead.

To configure the cache declaratively, you can use the `config` option provided by React Query. For example:

```js
const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(
  ['posts', id],
  () => fetch(`/api/posts/${id}`),
  {
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    refetchInterval: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
  }
);
```

In this example, the data will only be refetched when the user focuses the window, or when an hour has passed, whichever comes first.

By using both imperative and declarative cache management techniques, React Query provides you with the flexibility to manage your data in a way that works best for your application.

# Other features

React Query offers several additional features that can help you manage data in your application more effectively.

## Loading and Error States

React Query provides loading and error states, which allow you to know when data is being fetched and when errors occur. This makes it easier to handle these situations in your application and provide a better user experience.

For example, you can display a loading indicator while data is being fetched, or display an error message if there was an error fetching the data.

```jsx
const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(['posts', id], () => fetch(`/api/posts/${id}`));

if (isLoading) {
  return <p>Loading...</p>;
}

if (error) {
  return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
}

return <div>{data.title}</div>;

```

## Prefetching Data

React Query provides a way to prefetch data, which allows you to load data in advance of when it is actually needed. This can help improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of time it takes to load data when it is needed.

For example, you can prefetch data when a user navigates to a new page in your application, which can reduce the amount of time it takes to load the data when the user actually needs it.

```jsx
const prefetch = () => {
  useQuery(['posts', id], () => fetch(`/api/posts/${id}`), { enabled: false });
};

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <button onClick={prefetch}>Prefetch</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Pagination and Infinite Scroll

React Query makes it easy to implement features such as pagination and infinite scroll, which can help you manage large amounts of data in your application.

For example, you can use the `fetchMore` method provided by React Query to implement pagination, which allows you to load additional data as needed.

```jsx
const { data, error, isLoading, fetchMore } = useQuery(
  ['posts', page],
  () => fetch(`/api/posts?page=${page}`)
);

return (
  <div>
    <h1>Posts</h1>
    {data.map(post => (
      <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>
    ))}
    <button onClick={() => fetchMore({ page: page + 1 })}>Load More</button>
  </div>
);
```

These are just a few examples of the ways that React Query can help you manage data in your application. With its flexible API and easy-to-use features, React Query provides a powerful tool for managing data in your React applications.

# De-duplication of Requests and Mutations

One of the key features of React Query is its ability to de-duplicate requests and mutations, which can help improve the performance of your application and reduce the amount of unnecessary network traffic.

## De-duplication of Requests

React Query de-duplicates requests by caching the results of each request and reusing the cached data if the same request is made again. This can help improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of network traffic and minimizing the amount of time spent waiting for data to be fetched.

For example, if multiple components in your application need to fetch data for a user with the ID of `1`, React Query will only make a single request for that user's data and reuse the cached data for subsequent requests.

```js
const { data } = useQuery(['user', 1], () => fetch(`/api/users/1`));
```

## De-duplication of Mutations

React Query also de-duplicates mutations by ensuring that only one mutation is executed at a time for each unique set of variables. This can help improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of network traffic and preventing race conditions.

For example, if multiple components in your application need to update the same user's name, React Query will only execute a single mutation to update the user's name, even if multiple components trigger the mutation simultaneously.

```jsx
const [updateUser, { isLoading }] = useMutation(variables =>
  fetch(`/api/users/${variables.id}`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify(variables)
  })
);

function UpdateUserForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [id, setId] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = async e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    await updateUser({ id, name });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" value={id} onChange={e => setId(e.target.value)} />
      <input type="text" value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}>
        Update
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

In conclusion, React Query's de-duplication of requests and mutations is a key feature that can help you improve the performance of your application and ensure that data is managed in a consistent and efficient manner.
