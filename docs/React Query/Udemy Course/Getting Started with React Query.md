The first project on the course is related to these subjects:

1.  Data source: The project gets its data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/` which provides a fake REST API for testing and prototyping.
    
2.  Simple and focused: The project is very simple and focuses on the core concepts of React Query. This makes it an excellent starting point for learning React Query.
    
3.  Fetching data: One of the main objectives of the project is to demonstrate how to fetch data using React Query. You will learn how to use the `useQuery` hook to query the server and access the results.
    
4.  Loading and error states: In addition to fetching data, you will also learn how to manage loading and error states. React Query provides a convenient way to manage these states and keep your components up-to-date.
    
5.  React Query dev tools: You will also learn how to use the React Query dev tools to inspect your queries, cache, and mutations. This is a valuable tool for debugging and optimizing your React Query application.
    
6.  Pagination: Pagination is a common feature in many applications, and React Query makes it easy to implement. In this project, you will learn how to use React Query to paginate your data.
    
7.  Prefetching: Prefetching is a performance optimization technique that can improve the loading time of your application. In this project, you will learn how to use React Query to prefetch your data.
    
8.  Mutations: Mutations are used to modify data on the server. In this project, you will learn how to use React Query to run mutations and update your cache.

# Getting started with React Query

Getting started with React Query is easy, and you can begin by following these steps:

1.  Install the React Query library:

```shell
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

2.  Create a query client: The query client is responsible for managing all of your queries and cache. You can create a query client by using the `createQueryClient` function from the React Query library.

```js
import { createQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = createQueryClient();
```

3.  Apply the QueryProvider: The QueryProvider provides the query client and cache to all children components. You can wrap your root component in the QueryProvider and pass in the query client as the value.

```jsx
import { QueryProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = createQueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryProvider value={queryClient}>
      <PostsList/>
    </QueryProvider>
  );
}
```

4.  Run the `useQuery` hook: The `useQuery` hook is the primary way to query the server in React Query. You can use the `useQuery` hook in your components to fetch data and access the results.

```jsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const fetchPosts = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  return response.json();
};

const PostsList = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery('posts', fetchPosts);

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

```

In conclusion, these are the basic steps to get started with React Query. By following these steps, you will be able to quickly and easily query the server, manage your cache, and take advantage of the many other features of React Query.
