## About staleTime

React Query provides the option of setting a `staleTime` for your queries, which is the maximum amount of time that a query's data can be considered "stale" before it is automatically refetched. The concept of stale data is important because it allows us to ensure that the data displayed on the screen is always up to date, without having to constantly refetch it.

The data refetch only triggers for stale data, such as when a component is remounted or the window refocuses. The `staleTime` value represents the "max age" of the data and is defined in milliseconds. The time you set for staleTime will depend on the nature of the data you are fetching - for example, you may want to tolerate data being potentially out of date for 10 seconds or 1 minute. When defining the `staleTime`, it is recommended to use the following syntax: `1000 * 60 * 10 // 10 minutes`.

It's worth mentioning that the default `staleTime` is set to 0. The reasoning behind this is that it's a better question to ask "How is the data on the screen always up to date?" rather than "Why is my data not updating?".

## staleTime vs cacheTime

The `staleTime` and `cacheTime` are two different concepts in React Query. The `staleTime` is used for refetching data, while the `cacheTime` is used for data that may be reused later. If there is no active `useQuery` for a query, the query goes into "cold storage" and the cache data will expire after the `cacheTime` (which is set to five minutes by default). The cache time is based on how long it has been since the last active `useQuery`. Once the cache time has expired, the data is garbage collected.

The `cache` serves as a backup data source to display while fetching. This allows for a smooth user experience even if there are slow or intermittent network issues. It is important to note that the `cacheTime` should be set based on how often the data is expected to change, as well as how important it is to display the most up-to-date information to the user.

## Notes and questions

- Why does it matter if the data is stale?
  - When a client retrieves data from a server, that data is only accurate at the time it was retrieved. Over time, the data can become stale and no longer reflect the current state of the system. In some cases, this might not matter, but in other cases, it can be crucial to have up-to-date data. For instance, when displaying stock prices or weather information, it's essential to have fresh data, and stale data might give the wrong information to the user.
- Data refetch only triggers for stale data
  - React Query has a mechanism to manage stale data, and it only refetches data when it's stale. The staleTime parameter in React Query defines how long the data is considered stale and how long it should be displayed on the screen before refetching. For example, you can set the staleTime to 10 seconds, meaning that if the data was fetched more than 10 seconds ago, the data will be refetched.
- For example, component remount, window refocus
  - React Query also has a mechanism to automatically refetch data when certain events occur, such as when a component is remounted or when the window regains focus. This way, the data displayed on the screen is always up-to-date.
- staleTime translates to “max age”
  - The staleTime parameter in React Query translates to the maximum age of the data that should be displayed on the screen. The staleTime is a way to manage the trade-off between the freshness of the data and the frequency of the requests. The staleTime should be set according to the nature of the data and the requirements of the application.
- How to tolerate data potentially being out of date? 10 seconds? 1 minute?
  - This depends on the nature of the data The staleTime should be set according to the nature of the data and the requirements of the application. For instance, for stock prices or weather information, a staleTime of 10 seconds might be appropriate, whereas for blog posts or news articles, a staleTime of 1 minute might be more suitable.
- We always want to use the following syntax in the staleTime and cacheTime: 1000 _ 60 _ 10 // 10 minutes
  - The staleTime and cacheTime are set in milliseconds, and the recommended syntax to use is to multiply the time in minutes by 60 and then by 1000. For example, if you want to set the staleTime to 10 minutes, you would use the following syntax: `1000 * 60 * 10 // 10 minutes`.
- Why is default staleTime set to 0?

  - The default staleTime is set to 0 because the React Query library is designed to always display up-to-date data. By setting the staleTime to 0, React Query will refetch data whenever it's needed, ensuring that the data displayed on the screen is always fresh.

- staleTime is for refetching
  - The staleTime parameter in React Query is used to determine\ when data should be refetched from the server. When the data is considered stale (as defined by the staleTime), React Query will automatically refetch the data.
- Cache is for data that might be re-used later
  - The cacheTime parameter in React Query is used to manage the cache, which is used to store data that might be re-used later. The cacheTime defines how long the data will remain in the cache before it's considered stale and eligible for garbage collection.
